# Hi, I’m Eleonora - I go by Ellie.

I’m studying .NET Development at KYH Stockholm '26.

Former Development Leader at Region Stockholm, where I led the implementation of 1177's e-services. This experience informs my approach to user-centered design and digital transformation. 

My latest work focused on development with .NET/C#, database design and architecture, IoT systems with real-time communication using Azure Service Bus, REST APIs, and WPF/MVVM patterns.
